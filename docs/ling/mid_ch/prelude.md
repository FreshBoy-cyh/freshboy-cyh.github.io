If you want to learn many Sinitic languages (excluding Hokkien) and Sino-Xenics, it will save you much effort of trying to memorize the pronunciation of Chinese characters. After learning the phonology of middle Chinese, you will be able to easily inference the pronunciation of Chinese characters in most modern languages using Chinese characters, because they have evolved from the pronunciation of middle Chinese.

Also, Tang poetry and many other kinds of Chinese historical documents are written using rhymes of middle Chinese. If you learn the pronunciation of middle Chinese, it will be easier for you to study them.

## How Middle Chinese Pronunciation was Determined?

The phonology can be determined using the rhyming books (韻書), but the phonetic value of each phoneme can only be inferenced from the pronunciation of existing Sinitic languages and Sino-Xenics and some other clues found in historical documents. In other word, the phonetic values are not guaranteed to be true. So it is rational to memorize the onset, rhyme and tone __classes__ of every character, not the inferenced phonetic values.

## More About this Course

The phonetic system taught in this course is that of _Qie Yun_ (《切韻》) by _Fayan Lu_ (陸法言), because it is the earliest undisputed officially formulated rhyming book of Middle Chinese, recording the phonology of the Northern and Southern Dynasties period scholars. Many later rhyming books were based on _Qie Yun_.

Middle Chinese Pinyin introduced in this course is just a convenient way to annotate the pronunciation of middle Chinese, not the same as IPA.

For convenience and to avoid ambiguity, the following notes will be written in traditional Chinese (繁體中文).
