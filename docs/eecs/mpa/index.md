# Music Processing Analysis

Love from AudioLab@FAU. Textbook is Fundamentals of Music Processing (FMP).

Section 2 & 3 explains Fourier transform, DFT and STFT and how they produce the audio features introduced in Section 1, especially chromagrams. Not gonna take these notes, because I believe the readers of the tutorial must have learnt the math somewhere else. If not, there are many other great resourses about Fourier analysis on the Internet. For example, here is a great video on [wavelet transform](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnxqHcObNK4).
