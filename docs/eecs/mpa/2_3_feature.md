# 2. Fourier Analysis & 3. Audio Features

These two sections explains Fourier transform, DFT and STFT and how they produce the audio features we use. Not gonna take this note, because I believe the readers of the tutorial must have learnt this somewhere else. If not, there are many other great resourses about Fourier analysis on the Internet.
