# Linguistics

Here are my notes of some linguistics courses that I take in my spare time.

I was a middle schooler enthusiastic about linguistics. I bought 语言学纲要 by Peking University Press, read many linguistic posts on 知乎, and learnt some languages on Duolingo. But nobody has told me what I can do to reach a balance between idealism and realism, and I was too uninformed to ask anyone who knows about this, so I contributed nothing to the linguistics community and did not even know how to choose a proper major in my college. 

Now I think I live in a satisfactory status. If you are a middle school student interested in linguistcs, especially if you are from China, please feel free to contact me. I will answer your questions like treating myself from the past eagerly contacting the current me.
