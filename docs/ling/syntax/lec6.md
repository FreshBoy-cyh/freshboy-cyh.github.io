# Lec6 Binding

There are 3 kinds of rules in syntax:

1. Compositional rules: PS rules & X' theory, rules which generates an infinite array of hierarchically structured expressions.
2. Transformational rules: Movement rules, rules that convert one phrase structure into another
3. Interpretative rules（诠释规则）: Binding theory（约束理论）, rules which are relevant for the semantic interpretation of relations between constituents generated by PS rules

The goal of binding theory is to account for the distributions and interpretations of each class of NP.

## Binding in 3 Kinds of NPs

Pronouns: 有 person（人称）、number（数）、gender（性）、case（格）的语法范畴

Anaphor: reflexives (himself, herself ...), reciprocals (each other)

R-expressions: non-pronominal NPs with the intrinsic semantics not dependent on the interpretation of some other NPs, including names (John, ...), Epithets (the president, the actor, ...) ...

|Type|Where to Get Intended Reference||
|-|-|-|
|anaphor|must get from another NP in the same sentence||
|pronoun|may (not) get from another NP in the same sentence||
|E-expression|referentially independent||

Coindexing convention: whenever two NPs have the same index, one is dependent on the other for its interpretation. e.g. $John_i\ hopes\ that\ he_i\ will\ win.$

Antecedent（先行词）: an NP that gives its meaning (reference) to a pronoun or anaphor.
